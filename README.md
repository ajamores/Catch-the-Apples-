# Catch the Apples!

This is a simple game developed using JavaFX. The game is called "Catch The Apples". In this game, apples fall from the top of the screen and the user controls a basket to catch them. Each time an apple is caught, the score increments. Each time an apple is missed, a life is lost. The game continues until the user has lost all their lives.

## Key concepts learned during the development of this game include:

    - Working with JavaFX, including creating GUI components, positioning them, and styling them.
    - Animations with JavaFX, including the use of the AnimationTimer class.
    - Collision detection in JavaFX.
    - Separating game logic from the view.

The code for this game can be found in the Main.java file, located in the Assignment05_000315902 package. The game consists of a main method and a start method that sets up the game scene. The game scene includes a title, a canvas for the game screen, and labels for credits and instructions. The game canvas is where the basket and apples are displayed, and where the game animation takes place.
